Deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras  
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)  
Facebook Prophet  
Natural Language Processing (NLP)  

## üöÄ My Projects

**Foodborne Illness Forecasting:** Leveraged the SARIMA time series model to predict foodborne illnesses in the U.S. using data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis aimed to identify trends and seasonality in historical data to forecast future occurrences. However, the model faced challenges in capturing the irregularities, prompting recommendations for alternative forecasting methods.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized TensorFlow to build a Sequential neural network model using NLP techniques, aiming to classify sentiments from Amazon customer reviews. The model was designed to categorize reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into product reception.

**Market Basket Analysis:** Conducted a market basket analysis by employing data preprocessing techniques on a dataset. The dataset was transformed for association rule mining to derive insights into customer purchasing patterns.

**K-Means Clustering:** Performed k-means clustering on a telecommunication dataset. The elbow method was used to determine the optimal clusters and a silhouette score was used to evaluated cluster. The resulting cluster groups were visualized for better representation.

**Data Cleaning/Exploratory Data Analysis:** Managed data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a project. Imported and assessed the dataset for integrity, adjusted data types, and performed EDA to uncover underlying data patterns.
